# OOPD_ASSIGNMENT_1 (Monsoon 2024)

## Steps to compile and build the c++ code using Makefile ##

1). Place the Makefile in the root directory of your project folder, where your .cpp files are located. 
2). Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + ` or by navigating to Terminal from the menu.
3). Run Make Commands:
    i)make 
    "make" command uses the makefile, which contains rules on how to build the executables(.exe). The "make" command on execution generates two output binary files: debug_binary and the optimized_binary.

    ii)./debug_binary 
    the above command is used for executing the compiled binary named debug_binary that was generated using the Makefile.

    iii)./optimzied_binary 
    ./optimized_binary executes the compiled C++ program with optimization flags applied.
